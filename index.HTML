<h1>Japanese language tutorial</h1>
<h2>The basics of a complex language </h2>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Japanese is a very different lanuage from English.<br>
It has several alphabets,no plural nouns,and plenty of complex charecters or "Kanji" to remember.<br>
This may all sound very compelcated but with practice and a dictionary at hand it becomes less and less difulcult overtime.<br>
With all the current trade deals Japanese is not a very popular language to learn,<br>
But it's still very exiting.<br>

<h3>Greetings</h3>
<p>Like most languages Japanese has different greetings for each time of day.<br>
In the morning you say "ohio-gozieemas" meaning "good-morning".<br>
in the afternoon you say "con-nichi-wa" meaning "good-afernoon",this is the most commenly known greeting to americans.<br>
And finally in the evening you will say "con-ban-wa' meaning "good-evening".<br>
Tip:<br>
(If you end up useing these in real life remember to bow.)<br>

<h3>If you wan't to greet some one regardless of time of day here are some good terms to know:</h3><b>
